#Trials,  Excursions 

#Trials/Excursions

#Error trials = Mouse went at least 5cm, changed direction and went back all #the way to the side that they already visited, thereby not getting a reward
#AND trials where the mouse slowed down in the middle, and could still have #reached the other side (4cm/s cutoff)


#Performance = 1 - Error trials / (Total trials)
#Check that perf improves over time


->-Meet with Mark ask if NatNeuro is impossible, just go for Neuron

#>Figure4h, asymptotic decoding accuracy, not sig-direction SNR



#Explain in methods:

#Why integrating within bin

#Why we use classification and not regression, the need for a trial shuffle

#redo Fig1 with usable set > resend the C with 110

#Check if IPR correlates with average delta mu in the real data

#low priority:
#increase bins - go up to 30, 40 find the minimum
