## Selected functions implementing our methods

- Code used for detecting events in calcium traces: `utils/hyperdetect.m`
- Code used for computing the position signal and noise along the signal direction: `DecodeTensor.m` function `adjacent_metrics`
- Code used for computing the signal, noise, and SNR along the noise covariance eigenvectors: `@Cloud/eigen_snr_crossval.m`
- Code used for computing the loadings (cos angle) between the noise covariance eigenvectors and the signal direction, plus related quantities:`@Cloud/Cloud.m` function `Cloud`
- Code used for computing the normalized signal variance: `@Org/load_definitions.m` lambda function on line 43
