### HDF5 format for movies

Standard organization of the concatenated HDF5 file (i.e. generated by `concatenateHDF5`) is as follows:
- `/Data/Images`: The main movie matrix (`[height x width x num_frames]`)
- `/Params/TrimVals`: The trim parameters (e.g. `[15 5]` -- drop 15 frames from beginning and end of each trial) used in the concatenation.
- `/Params/DownsmpFactor`: Spatial downsampling factor used in the initial concatenation.
- `/Params/FrameRate`: Frame rate (fps) of the movie in real time.
 
The contents of `/Params` should be carried over through the preprocessing operations via `copy_hdf5_params`, and updated as appropriate. (For example, time-binning by 2x should correctly adjust `/Params/FrameRate`.)

Other datasets may be used.
