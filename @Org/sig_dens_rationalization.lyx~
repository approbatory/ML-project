\begin_layout Subsection*
Approximate analytic connection of the asymptotic ratio to signal density
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Signal density is defined as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\text{Signal density}=\frac{1}{N}\cdot\frac{\left(\sum_{k}(\Delta\mu_{k})^{2}\right)^{2}}{\sum_{k}(\Delta\mu_{k})^{4}}=:\frac{1}{N}\cdot\frac{M_{2}^{2}}{M_{4}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I am using 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{4}$
\end_inset

 as short notation for the sums of squares or fourth-powers of the elements
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\mu$
\end_inset

 over neurons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The asymptotic ratio is the ratio of the asymptotic SNR along 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\mu$
\end_inset

 to the shuffled asymptotic SNR along 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\mu$
\end_inset

.
 When I checked those two variables separately (not as a ratio), there was
 no correlation to the asymptotic SNR, but there was a correlation to the
 shuffled asymptotic SNR.
 Let's inspect more closely the shuffled asymptotic SNR.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Shuffled asymptotic SNR
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The shuffled asymptotic SNR is the ratio of the rate of change of the signal,
 which is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\text{Signal slope}=\frac{1}{N}\cdot\sum_{k}(\Delta\mu_{k})^{2}=\frac{1}{N}\cdot M_{2}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
to the rate of change of the noise, which is harder to determine because
 it appears to converge to a constant value or nearly constant value (it
 depends on the properties of the distribution of signal and noise among
 neurons).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The noise along 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\mu$
\end_inset

 in the shuffled case (idealized to mean that there are no noise correlations
 at all) is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\text{Noise }=\frac{\sum_{k}(\Delta\mu_{k})^{2}\sigma_{k}^{2}}{\sum_{k}(\Delta\mu_{k})^{2}}=\frac{\sum_{k}(\Delta\mu_{k})^{2}\sigma_{k}^{2}}{M_{2}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In other words, it is the weighted average of the noise variances 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{k}^{2}$
\end_inset

 based on the signal quantities 
\begin_inset Formula $(\Delta\mu_{k})^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Since it is a weighted average, it is bounded above by the maximum value
 of the random variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{k}^{2}\sim\text{Dist}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is a random neuron and Dist is the distribution from which the noise variance
 of a random neuron comes from.
 If we reasonably assume that individual neurons will carry only up to a
 maximal amount of noise then the noise in the signal direction will necessarily
 converge to a constant.
 If we measure the slope in the asymptotic regime it must be 0.
 The way we are calculating the slope of the noise is by fitting a line
 to all noise values from ensembles larger than 100 neurons.
 Of course, the asymptotic regime can never be exactly reached, so the values
 of the slopes of the noise in the shuffled case would be a nonzero finite
 slope value that captures the rate of convergence to the asymptotic value.
 It is reasonable to assume that this quantity is proportional to the value
 of the asymptotic noise itself, if the noise in the signal direction of
 all sessions converges at a similar rate per additional neuron in the ensemble.
 Let us denote the constant of proportionality as 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

.
 Now the estimated rate of change of noise is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\text{Noise slope}=\gamma\frac{\sum_{k}(\Delta\mu_{k})^{2}\sigma_{k}^{2}}{M_{2}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We take the ratio of the signal slope to the noise slope to get the estimated
 asymptotic SNR:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\text{Shuffled asymp. SNR}=\frac{\text{Signal slope}}{\text{Noise slope}}=\frac{M_{2}/N}{\gamma\sum_{k}(\Delta\mu_{k})^{2}\sigma_{k}^{2}/M_{2}}=\frac{1}{\gamma N}\cdot\frac{M_{2}^{2}}{\sum_{k}(\Delta\mu_{k})^{2}\sigma_{k}^{2}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This quantity will become proportional to signal density if we include another
 assumption, that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{k}^{2}\propto(\Delta\mu_{k})^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 This assumption is almost certainly false, since the noise density is approxima
tely twice the signal density, whereas proportionality would imply that
 they should be equal.
 However, a reasonable assumption is that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{k}^{2}\sim(\Delta\mu_{k})^{2}$
\end_inset

, meaning that they are correlated.
 If that is the case, then the term in the denominator of the shuffled asymptoti

 becomes correlated with 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{4}$
\end_inset

, which in turn means that shuffled asymptotic SNR is correlated with signal
 density.
\end_layout

\[
\text{Shuffled asymp. SNR}\sim\frac{1}{\gamma N}\cdot\frac{M_{2}^{2}}{M_{4}}\sim\text{Signal density}
